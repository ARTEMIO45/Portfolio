      <p>
        I recently graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
        Northern Illinois University, with an emphasis in software development.
        Additionally, I achieved a mobile certificate in programming for both
        Android and iOS platforms. During my academic journey, I gained valuable
        internship experience as a data engineer with ALDI. As a
        first-generation student coming from an immigrant family, my entire
        journey has taught me the importance of perseverance and
        self-motivation. I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn new
        technologies. Currently, I am seeking opportunities to further my
        programming knowledge and contribute to innovative projects. My ultimate
        goal is to make a positive impact in the world, and I believe that
        pursuing my passion for technology is the perfect avenue to achieve
        that.
