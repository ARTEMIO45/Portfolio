      Hello! Welcome to my portfolio. My name is Artemio, and I'm thrilled to have you explore my journey with me. As a first-generation student, I've always strived to obtain a higher education and educate myself. Since I was young, I've been fascinated by technology, constantly questioning how computers work and what goes on under the hood. During my associate's degree in Electrical Automated Systems, I became even more curious about how industrial machines operated. Working with PLCs opened my curiosity even further, leading me to pursue a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Throughout my journey, I've gained knowledge in front-end, back-end, and assembly programming. During my junior year, I interned with Aldi as a data engineer, where I delved deeper into how data is retrieved and utilized to create functional applications. Eager to continue learning, I pursued additional classes to obtain my mobile programming certificate

    Project Title: Food Expiry Tracker

Description:

The Food Expiry Tracker is an innovative solution to address the issue of food wastage due to expired products. Built using SwiftUI and Core Data, this app empowers users to effectively manage their food inventory by allowing them to input the items they have in their homes.

One of the major challenges faced by households is the inability to keep track of the expiry dates of various food items, often leading to unnecessary waste. With the Food Expiry Tracker, users can easily enter details about the food products they own, including the name of the item and its expiry date.

The app leverages the power of Core Data to persistently store this information, ensuring that users have access to their food inventory data even when offline. By maintaining a comprehensive list of their food items and their respective expiry dates, users can make informed decisions about meal planning and grocery shopping.

The Food Expiry Tracker not only helps users prevent food wastage but also promotes sustainability by encouraging mindful consumption. With the ability to quickly check the expiry status of their food items, users can optimize their usage, minimize waste, and contribute to a more sustainable lifestyle.

Key Features:

    Intuitive user interface for easy data input and management
    Seamless integration with Core Data for efficient data storage and retrieval
    Customizable alerts and reminders to notify users about approaching expiry dates
    Comprehensive food inventory management system to track items in real-time
    Enhanced user experience with SwiftUI's modern design principles and interactive elements

By providing users with a convenient and reliable tool to monitor their food inventory, the Food Expiry Tracker aims to reduce food wastage, promote sustainable consumption practices, and empower individuals to make more informed choices about their food usage.
