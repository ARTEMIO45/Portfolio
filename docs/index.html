                The Food Expiry Tracker is a user-friendly app designed to combat food
                wastage caused by expired products. Using SwiftUI and Core Data, it allows
                users to easily input and manage their food inventory. By logging item
                names and expiry dates, users can make informed decisions about meal
                planning and grocery shopping. The app utilizes Core Data for offline
                access to inventory data. This promotes sustainability through mindful
                consumption, helping users minimize waste and optimize usage, ultimately
                aiding them in saving money and contributing to a more sustainable
                lifestyle.

                The project involved the development of an Auto Parts E-commerce Website
                powered by the MERN stack. It comprised three interfaces: one for browsing
                and purchasing parts, another for warehouse inventory management and order
                fulfillment, and an admin interface for adjusting shipping prices based on
                part weights. This integrated system facilitated seamless transactions and
                efficient inventory control, benefiting users across various roles.

                Modern web technologies and agile development methodologies, particularly
                Scrum, were employed by the development team to ensure scalability and
                robustness. Emphasizing user-centric design and smooth integration, the
                platform delivered an intuitive experience for both customers and
                administrators. Through collaborative efforts and meticulous attention to
                detail, a versatile solution was crafted to meet the diverse needs of
                clients and end-users.
